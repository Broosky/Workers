# 🛠️ **Workers**

This is a proof-of-concept app for the [Gatherers-Historic](https://github.com/Broosky/Gatherers-Historic) repo that I rediscovered on an old drive. I’m adding it here for sentimental value and to share the very early stages of the project!

## 🧩 **Key Features**

- **Early Concept**  
  A basic implementation of the resource gathering mechanic with minimal AI logic, laying the foundation for later improvements in **Gatherers-Historic**.

- **Basic Traversal**  
  Implements programmatic destinations, using basic **linear algebra** to move units along paths.

## 🧩 **A Bit of History**

This app was one of the earliest experiments in the *Gatherers* series, built during my reading week in 2010. Although it’s simple by today’s standards, it holds an important place in my development journey.

## ⚙️ **Windows Instructions**

After adjusting the linker settings, you can compile and run the app on Windows 11 using **Dev-C++** and **MinGW**. Simply follow the instructions [here](https://bloodshed.net/) to set up the environment.
