This is a proof-of-concept app for the [Gatherers-Historic](https://github.com/Broosky/Gatherers-Historic) repo that I rediscovered on an old drive. I’m adding it here for sentimental value and to share the very early stages of the project!

## 🔹 **A Bit of History**

This app was one of the earliest experiments in the *Gatherers* series, built during my reading week in 2010. Although it’s simple by today’s standards, it holds an important place in my development journey.
