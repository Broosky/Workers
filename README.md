# 🛠️ **Workers**

This is a proof-of-concept app for the **Gatherers-Historic** repo that I rediscovered on an old drive. I’m adding it here for sentimental value and to share the early stages of the project!

After adjusting the linker settings, it compiles and runs smoothly on Windows 11. I haven’t tested it on other systems yet.

## 🧩 **A Bit of History**

This app was one of the earliest experiments in the *Gatherers* series, built during my reading week in 2010. Although it’s simple by today’s standards, it holds an important place in my development journey.
