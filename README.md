This is a proof-of-concept app for the [Gatherers-Legacy](https://github.com/Broosky/Gatherers-Legacy) repo that I rediscovered on an old drive. Iâ€™m adding it here for sentimental value and to share the very early stages of the project!

## ðŸ”¹ **A Bit of History**

This app was one of the earliest experiments in the *Gatherers* series, built during my school reading week in 2010. Although itâ€™s simple by todayâ€™s standards, it holds an important place in my development journey.
